Subject: Complaint Regarding Recent Service Call - 197253

Dear Honda Support Team,

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the service I received during a recent visit on May 27,2025 at Honda Service Centre,Lucknow.

The technician arrived caused further damage. Specifically, the brakes of the bike are now even worse than before.

This experience has been very frustrating, and I expect a resolution. Please advise on the steps you will take to address this matter.

Sincerely,
Hari
